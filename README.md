# Readme Generator

## Description: 

This project was created so that I create a professional README file quickly and easily. 
During this project I learned how to use multiple javascript files and export them. Also how to use inquirer a little bit more.

## Installation:

1.) To use this project, you need clone or copy this code from the repository.<br>
2.) Once you have the code on your local computer, make sure that your you have inquire also installed. If you don't, then use the command in your terminal "npm i". This should install the inquire JSON file.


## Usage:

After everything is installed, open up the integrated terminal of the index.js file. In this terminal write "node index". You will then be prompted to fill out multiple questions. Fill each one out. After answering all the questions you will have a completed README file!<br/>
Here is a quick video demonstrating it!: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aV7FlcRKZ4Yz8VmiPDYv-zgrmWbhH1yX/view

#### Note: <br>
For the demonstration I did not choose a license, but if you did however then it would show up along with a badge. If this badge is clicked on it will bring you to a spot to give you more information on that license.
